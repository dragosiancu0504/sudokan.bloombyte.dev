**$100 USD (One Hundred U.S. Dollars)** or the amount you paid to use Sudokan in the 12 months preceding the claim, **whichever is less**.

**Since Sudokan is free**, our maximum liability is effectively **$100 USD**.

This cap applies to:
- All claims combined (not per claim)
- All theories of liability
- All damages (direct, indirect, consequential, etc.)

### 12.4 Basis of the Bargain

**These limitations are fundamental to our agreement**. We offer Sudokan for free, and these limitations reflect that:

- The App is free (no payment, no revenue from users directly)
- We cannot afford unlimited liability for a free app
- You accept these risks in exchange for free access

**Without these limitations**, we could not offer Sudokan on a free basis.

### 12.5 Jurisdiction-Specific Liability Limits

**Some jurisdictions do not allow limitation of liability for**:
- Personal injury
- Fraudulent misrepresentation
- Gross negligence or willful misconduct
- Certain consumer protection violations

**If this applies to you**:
- The limitations above may not apply in full
- We remain liable to the extent required by law
- See Sections 18 (EU Consumer Rights) and 19 (California Consumer Rights)

**To the extent liability cannot be limited**, it is limited to the maximum extent allowed by law.

### 12.6 Allocation of Risk

**You acknowledge and agree that**:
- ✅ You use Sudokan at your own risk
- ✅ You're responsible for backing up important data (though Sudokan has no personal data)
- ✅ You're responsible for device security (screen lock, OS updates)
- ✅ You understand the App may have bugs or errors

**Fair allocation**: These Terms allocate risks between you and us. You accept certain risks in exchange for free access to the App.

## 16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

### 16.1 Governing Law

**These Terms are governed by the laws of Romania**, without regard to conflict of law principles.

**Why Romania**:
- Bloom Byte SRL is a Romanian company
- Our principal place of business is in Romania
- Romania is an EU member state (GDPR compliance built-in)

**Applicable laws include**:
- Romanian Civil Code
- Romanian Consumer Protection Law (Law 296/2004)
- EU regulations (GDPR, Consumer Rights Directive)

### 16.2 Jurisdiction

**For disputes** (see Section 17 for dispute resolution process):

**General Jurisdiction**:
- Courts of Romania have **exclusive jurisdiction** for disputes arising from these Terms
- Specifically: Courts of Bucharest, Romania (our registered office location)

**Consumer Protection**:
- **If you're an EU consumer**, you may also bring claims in your country of residence (EU Consumer Rights Directive)
- **If you're a California consumer**, see Section 19 for specific rights

### 16.3 United Nations Convention on Contracts

**The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)** does NOT apply to these Terms.

**Why excluded**: CISG is for commercial sales, not consumer software licenses.

### 16.4 Waiver of Jury Trial

**TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND BLOOM BYTE SRL WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL** for any disputes arising from these Terms.

**Disputes will be resolved by a judge** (or arbitrator, if arbitration is chosen).

**Some jurisdictions may not allow this waiver**. If so, it doesn't apply.

### 16.5 Export Control

**You represent and warrant that**:
- ✅ You're not located in a country subject to U.S. embargo (e.g., North Korea, Syria, Iran, Cuba - subject to change)
- ✅ You're not on U.S. government restricted party lists (e.g., Specially Designated Nationals)

**If you're in a restricted country**, you may not use Sudokan.

**Compliance**: You agree to comply with all export control laws and regulations.

---

## 17. Dispute Resolution

### 17.1 Informal Resolution First

**Before filing a lawsuit or arbitration**, you agree to:

1. **Contact us** at contact@bloombyte.dev with subject "Dispute Resolution"
2. **Describe the dispute** in detail (what happened, what you want)
3. **Allow 30 days** for us to investigate and respond
4. **Negotiate in good faith** to resolve the dispute amicably

**Goal**: Resolve disputes without formal proceedings (saves time and money for both parties).

### 17.2 Arbitration (Optional)

**If informal resolution fails**, you and we may agree to resolve disputes through **binding arbitration** instead of court.

**Arbitration benefits**:
- Faster than court litigation
- Lower costs (no court fees, limited discovery)
- Private (not public record)
- Final (limited appeal rights)

**Arbitration rules**:
- **Arbitration body**: Romanian Court of International Commercial Arbitration (or mutually agreed arbitrator)
- **Location**: Bucharest, Romania (or mutually agreed location)
- **Language**: English or Romanian
- **Costs**: Each party pays its own costs (arbitrator fees split equally)

**Arbitration agreement is optional**: You must explicitly agree to arbitrate (not automatic).

### 17.3 Class Action Waiver

**TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE TO BRING CLAIMS ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY**, not as a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.

**No class arbitration**: If you agree to arbitration, you waive class arbitration.

**Why**: Class actions are complex and costly. We offer individual dispute resolution (more practical for a free app).

**Some jurisdictions may not allow this waiver** (e.g., EU, California). If so, it doesn't apply.

### 17.4 Small Claims Court

**You may bring claims in small claims court** (if your jurisdiction has one) instead of arbitration or regular court, if:
- The claim qualifies for small claims (amount and type)
- Small claims court has jurisdiction

**Small claims benefits**: Fast, inexpensive, informal.

### 17.5 Injunctive Relief

**Either party may seek injunctive relief** (court orders to stop harmful conduct) without waiting for arbitration or informal resolution, if:
- Immediate harm is threatened (e.g., intellectual property infringement, security breach)
- Delay would cause irreparable injury

**Example**: If someone is reverse engineering and distributing Sudokan, we may seek an immediate court order to stop them.

### 17.6 EU Online Dispute Resolution

**If you're an EU consumer**, you can use the EU Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform:
- **Website**: [ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr)
- **Purpose**: Resolve disputes with online traders

**We're not obligated to participate** in ODR, but we'll consider it if requested.

---

## 18. EU Consumer Rights

**If you're a consumer in the European Union**, you have additional rights under EU law that these Terms cannot override.

### 18.1 Statutory Guarantees

**EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU)** provides:

**Right to conformity**:
- ✅ Digital content (Sudokan) must be as described
- ✅ Must be fit for purpose
- ✅ Must have acceptable quality

**If Sudokan fails to conform**:
- You may request repair or update (we'll fix bugs)
- If repair isn't possible, you may request a proportionate price reduction (N/A for free app)
- In serious cases, you may terminate the contract (uninstall and request data deletion)

**Legal guarantee period**: At least **2 years** from delivery (initial download).

### 18.2 No Waiver of Statutory Rights

**These Terms do NOT waive your statutory rights** as an EU consumer, including:
- ✅ Right to conformity (Section 18.1)
- ✅ Right to withdraw (limited for digital content - see Section 18.3)
- ✅ Right to complain to consumer authorities
- ✅ Right to sue in your country of residence

**If these Terms conflict with EU law**, EU law prevails.

### 18.3 Right to Withdraw (Limited)

**EU Consumer Rights Directive** normally gives consumers 14 days to withdraw from distance contracts.

**However**: For digital content, withdrawal rights are waived if:
- ✅ You consented to immediate performance (by using the App)
- ✅ You acknowledged loss of withdrawal right

**By using Sudokan immediately after download**, you waive the 14-day withdrawal right (standard for apps).

**Exceptions**:
- If the App is defective, you have conformity rights (Section 18.1)
- If we violated your rights, you may withdraw and request a refund (N/A for free app)

### 18.4 Unfair Contract Terms

**EU Unfair Contract Terms Directive (93/13/EEC)** prohibits unfair terms in consumer contracts.

**If any term is deemed unfair**:
- The term is unenforceable (but rest of Terms remain)
- We'll replace it with a fair term (or it's deleted)

**Examples of potentially unfair terms** (subject to judicial review):
- Excessive limitation of liability (Section 12) - may be limited for free apps
- Unilateral right to modify terms (Section 15) - we provide notice for material changes
- Broad indemnification (Section 13) - only applies if you violate Terms

**Our position**: These Terms are fair given Sudokan is free and ad-supported. If a court disagrees, we'll comply.

### 18.5 GDPR Rights

**See Privacy Policy** for full GDPR rights (data access, erasure, portability, etc.).

**GDPR rights cannot be waived** by these Terms.

### 18.6 Consumer Dispute Resolution

**If you have a complaint**:
1. Contact us at contact@bloombyte.dev (we'll try to resolve)
2. Contact your national consumer protection authority
3. Use the EU ODR platform: [ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr)
4. File a complaint with Romanian consumer authority (our location)
5. Sue in your country's courts (you can sue in your home country)

**No mandatory arbitration**: EU consumers cannot be forced to arbitrate (Section 17.2 is optional).

---

## 19. California Consumer Rights

**If you're a California resident**, you have additional rights under California law.

### 19.1 CCPA/CPRA Rights

**See Privacy Policy Section 7.3** for full California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) rights:
- Right to know what data we collect
- Right to delete data
- Right to opt out of "sale" (we don't sell, but you can disable personalized ads)
- Right to correct inaccurate data
- Right to non-discrimination

**CCPA rights cannot be waived** by these Terms.

### 19.2 California Civil Code § 1542 Waiver

**California Civil Code § 1542** provides:

> "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."

**You expressly waive § 1542** as it relates to releasing us from claims.

**What this means**: If we settle a dispute, you release all claims (even unknown ones). This waiver is common in settlements.

### 19.3 California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA)

**California CLRA** protects consumers from unfair or deceptive business practices.

**Our compliance**:
- ✅ We disclose all terms clearly (no hidden fees - app is free)
- ✅ We provide accurate descriptions (app does what we say)
- ✅ We honor CCPA rights

**If we violate CLRA**:
- You may demand correction (30-day notice required before lawsuit)
- You may sue for damages, injunction, or attorney fees

**Contact for CLRA complaints**: contact@bloombyte.dev

### 19.4 California Proposition 65 (N/A)

**Prop 65** requires warnings for products containing chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive harm.

**Sudokan is software (no physical product)**, so Prop 65 doesn't apply.

### 19.5 Arbitration and Class Action Waiver (Limited)

**California law limits class action waivers** in consumer contracts.

**Section 17.3 class action waiver** may not apply to California residents if:
- The dispute involves significant public interest
- The waiver is unconscionable under California law

**If the waiver is unenforceable**, you may bring class actions in California courts.

---

## 20. Severability

### 20.1 Invalid Provisions

**If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable** by a court or arbitrator:

- ✅ That provision is **severed** (removed) from these Terms
- ✅ The **rest of the Terms remain in full effect**
- ✅ The invalid provision is **replaced** with a valid provision that achieves the same intent

**Example**: If a court finds the limitation of liability (Section 12) excessive for EU consumers, that section is modified to comply with EU law, but other sections remain.

### 20.2 Interpretation

**Courts will interpret these Terms** to:
- Give maximum effect to the parties' intent
- Uphold as many provisions as possible
- Avoid rendering any provision meaningless

**No presumption against drafter**: These Terms are not interpreted against us just because we drafted them.

---

## 21. Waiver

### 21.1 No Waiver by Inaction

**Our failure to enforce any provision** of these Terms does NOT constitute a waiver of that provision or our right to enforce it later.

**Example**: If you violate the Terms and we don't immediately terminate your access, that doesn't mean we waive our right to terminate you in the future or enforce the Terms against others.

### 21.2 Waiver Must Be in Writing

**Any waiver of these Terms must be in writing** and signed by an authorized representative of Bloom Byte SRL.

**Verbal waivers are not valid**.

### 21.3 No Implied Waivers

**Waiver of one breach doesn't waive future breaches**.

**Example**: If we allow you to continue using the App after one Terms violation, that doesn't mean we waive our right to terminate you for subsequent violations.

---
